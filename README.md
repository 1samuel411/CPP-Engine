# CPP-Engine
A small C++ Game Engine I am creating to help with learning the language, using Flappy Bird as the main project to drive the development.
I'm using GLFW for rendering and input.

# Inspiration
The engine is heavily inspired by Unity's Component system and is object based.
Each object contains components and always contains a Transform component which contains information such as, rotation, scale, and position.
